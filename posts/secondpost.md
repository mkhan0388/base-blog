I have to start by saying that being on this course has really opened my eyes to the world of web development. I had limited knowledge going into this course but with the help of the tutors my knowledge has expanded. What helps massivley is having tutors who work in the industry so we actually get real world advice and the advice has been amazing. So I wanna say Thank you to all of you!!

## What I found Difficult

I think the most difficult aspect for me was the static site generators, more specifically the eleventy blog. When we first given the task I was confused like F***. I had no idea what the code was doing, it was all copnfusing to me. As time went on and my knowledge every so slightly increased my grasp of the blog has also. Not there yet but moving in the right direction. The turtorial video link we were given helped massivly. 

## What I Liked

Moving on to what I liked, well that would have to be the Javascript. I had no javaScript experience before this course, it was on mt to to do list. I found the code amazing and just spending time writing code and trying to fix problems is probably why I liked it so much. I did find some of it difficult but I enjoyed searching for the solutions and this tied in to why I would like to become a developer. The idea having problems and looking for solutions is what i find appealing. 

## Conclusion
Loved the course and would deffo recommend this course to others, of course with it being a pilot course they were some things that could be improved on but I'm sure with time those would be ironed out. I would love to come back and maybe teach on this course if I become at least a semi compotent developer.
